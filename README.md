# ChallengingMe-1-VueJs

## This is a WIP project

I will try to improve this project more and more, always looking for the best practices and ways to maintain a fast application and clean code. I am totally open to criticism and suggestions.

It's based on Coodesh challenge, but I pretend to go further.

The design is not the initial focus but the structure.

I'm using differents approachs for fetching data, it's on purpose. The focus is to learn concepts and practice.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
